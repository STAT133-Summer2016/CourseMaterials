# Introduction
Welcome to STAT133, Concepts in Computing with Data.  In this class, we will be exploring a variety of computational tools used for organizing, exploring, wrangling, and visualizing data.  While most of the class will be focused on the R statistical computing language, we will dabble a little with the UNIX command line, git, SQL, and XML as time allows.

There are no prerequisites for the course (high school algebra and statistics will suffice), so we won't be delving too deeply into the theory. That being said, you will still be expected to think critically about the problems posed during the course. You don't have to be a tech guru to pass this class, but if you're a total technophobe, you might find this class particularly challenging.

# Office Hours

Day      | Time
-------- | -----
Monday   | 10am-12pm
Wednesday| 11am-1pm

Tentatively, Andrew's office hours will be held in the undergraduate computer lab on the 4th floor of Evans.  The GSI's office hour schedule is TBD.

# Email Policy
To ensure that your emails aren't lost in the sea of academic emails, please put the following information in the subject line of every email you send:

* A [STAT133] tag
* Your Name, followed by a colon
* An actual subject

An example subject line might read 
```
[STAT133] Michael Walker: Medical Absence
```
Emails should only be used when private information is involved (e.g. DSP documentation, excused late-submission requests, etc). Questions about assignments and course material should be posted on Piazza so that everyone can benefit.

# Grading

Your course grade is computed using a point system with a total of 1000 points, divided as follows:

Assignment        | Points 
----------------- | ------
Homework          | 320
Lab Assignments   | 80
Midterm Exam      | 160
Final Exam        | 200
Final Project     | 200
Participation     | 20
GitHub Maintenance| 20

Letter grade assignments will be done according to the following table:

Points         | Grade
-------------- | -----
980+           | A+
930-979        | A
900-929        | A-
860-899        | B+
820-859        | B
780-819        | B-
750-779        | C+
720-749        | C
690-719        | C-
660-689        | D+
630-659        | D
600-629        | D-
Below 600      | F

THIS CLASS IS NOT CURVED.  Anyone asking about this after the add/drop period will immediately lose a point Please note that the steps are wider in the B range.  This class is not curved, so what you get is... what you get. 

## Homework 
There will be a total of eight homework assignments during the semester, each worth 20 points.  The homework will be designed to take 1-6 hours, depending on your familiarity with programming. In general, they will be used to expand on concepts covered in the class and might require some minor "googling".  You are encouraged to discuss the concepts in groups, but your submission should be your own.

tl;dr: HW assigned 5pm Monday, due 11:59pm next Monday, submitted on bCourses, documented on github Assignments will be posted at 5pm on Mondays an will be due at 11:59pm the following Monday via bCourses.  Documentation of your work should be done via GitHub (to be explained in class).   With the exception of documented emergencies (e.g. hospitalization), no late submissions will be accepted without prior approval.   I encourage you to try to submit assignments early so that you can resolve technical difficulties in office hours. To discourage last-minute submissions, the GSI and I will stop responding to questions about the homework at 5pm on the due date of the assignment.  No assignments will be dropped.

## Lab Assignments
Labs due at 11:59pm of same day Labs consist of short assignments meant to reinforce the material in lecture.  In general, you can expect for these to be more of the "digest and regurgitate" types of problems.  Lab assignments will be posted at the beginning of sessions and are due at 11:59pm on the same day.  One lab will be selected at random each week for grading.  Again, no late submissions will be accepted.

## Midterm Exam
The midterm exam is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 9:00am in Evans 342, the usual classroom.  Other details to follow.

## Final Exam
The final exam is scheduled for Thursday, August 11, 2016.  It will be cumulative.  Other details to follow.

## Final Project
The final project will be assigned after the midterm on June 30, 2016.  It will be a group project that involves your finding and analyzing a suitably complex data set of your choice.  The project will be due at 11:59pm on Tuesday, August 9, 2016.

## Participation
Half of this grade will come from your participation in lecture.  At the beginning of every week, I will send out a list of people I intend to cold call to share their inputs randomly during lecture.  This grade will not be based off the correctness of your answers, but rather your willingness to share your thoughts.  The other half of this grade will come from your participation on Piazza.  To avoid having people figure out ways to "game the system," I will not divulge the grading algorithm here.

## GitHub Maintenance
You will be expected to maintain a GitHub repository for this class.  This grade will be based off spot-checks of completeness throughout the semester.

# Working Together
With the obvious exception of exams, I encourage you to discuss and share ideas in this class with your friends and classmates.  You will get much more from this class from collaboration than you will trying to do everything by yourself.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Practice communicating ideas by answering questions.  If you find something interesting, share it!  

# Academic Dishonesty
pls no While you are free to discuss ideas with others, please do not share actual code.  For more information, please refer to the [student code-of-conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct).
