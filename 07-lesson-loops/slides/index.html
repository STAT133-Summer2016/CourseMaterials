    <h2>Repeated Actions</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Say you wanted to repeat an action over and over again, maybe with some slight changes.  For example, you might want your computer to sing <em>99 Bottles of Beer</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="r">print(&quot;99 bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;99 bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">print(&quot;99 bottles of beer!&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;99 bottles of beer!&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">print(&quot;Take one down, pass it around.&quot;)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Take one down, pass it around.&quot;

    <h2>Looping</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Now you could type out the 396 lines of the song by hand or you could have your computer do what&#39;s called a loop.</p>

<pre><code class="r">for (n in 99:1) {
  print(str_c(n, &quot; bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;))
  print(str_c(n, &quot; bottles of beer!&quot;))

  print(str_c(n-1, &quot; bottles of beer on the wall!&quot;))

    <h2>For loops</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>There are three main types of loops in R: repeat loops, while loops, and for loops.  We will only talk about the last two.  A for loop executes a set of actions over an index set.  So, in the example below, the for loop continually adds one to the numbers in the set <code>c(1,2,3)</code> sequentially, and then prints out the result.</p>

<pre><code class="r">for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i + 1)
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 2
## [1] 3
## [1] 4
</code></pre>

    <h2>Common Uses</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>One common use is for the index set to be a set of indices of an object:</p>

<pre><code class="r">v &lt;- c(3, 5, rep(0, 8))

# This code will modify the third through fifth elements of v

for (i in 3:10) {
  v[i] &lt;- v[i-2] + v[i-1]
}
v
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##  [1]   3   5   8  13  21  34  55  89 144 233
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>i</code> is used to call on elements of <code>v</code>.  It&#39;s never used for its face value.</p>

    <h2>Common uses</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Of course the for loop isn&#39;t just constrained to looping over indices.  It can in fact loop over any set.  In the example below, it loops over a character vector:</p>

<pre><code class="r">x &lt;- data.frame(first_column = 1:3, second_column = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), third_column = 7:9)
names(x)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;first_column&quot;  &quot;second_column&quot; &quot;third_column&quot;
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="r">for (name in names(x)) {
  print(x[[name]])
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 1 2 3
## [1] a b c
## Levels: a b c
## [1] 7 8 9
</code></pre>

  <hgroup>
    <h2>While Loops</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>A while loop repeats a set of actions until its stop condition is met.  In the example below, the loop repeatedly divides by 2 until it hits an odd number.  The stop condition would be hitting the odd number.</p>

<pre><code class="r"># Start off with some value
n &lt;- 748192
i &lt;- 0
# The stop condition is the negation of the statement in the parentheses
while (n %% 2 == 0) {
  n &lt;- n/2
  i &lt;- i + 1 # this i is being used as a counter for verification
}

print(c(n = n, i = i, verification = 2^i * n))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>##            n            i verification 
##        23381            5       748192

    <h2>Initializing Values</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Notice that it&#39;s often the case that you have some initial value for the loop.  Otherwise the object that you want to change using a loop wouldn&#39;t actually exist!  This applies to both for and while loops. </p>

<pre><code class="r"># Count the number of times you can subtract 5 from a number n before it&#39;s less than 5
HowManyFives &lt;- function(n) {
  counter &lt;- 0 # Initialize a counter
  while (n &gt;= 5) {
    n &lt;- n - 5 # update the value of n
    counter &lt;- counter + 1 # update the counter
  }
  return(counter)

    <h2>When to use each type of loop</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The general idea is as follows: use for loops for when</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a finite number of repetitions</li>
<li>You know the set you want to loop over (e.g. the indices of a vector)</li>
<li>You want to definitely loop over everything in that set</li>
</ul>

<p>Use while loops when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t know how many times you want to repeat something</li>
<li>You&#39;ll know when to stop &quot;when you see it&quot; (stopping condition)</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Let&#39;s Write Some Loops</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Using a loop, write a function that will replace all the <code>99</code> values in odd columns of a data frame with NA.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s break down the problem into digestable bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to know the number of columns (<code>ncol</code>)</li>
<li>We&#39;ll need to only have the odd columns (<code>seq</code> or <code>%%</code>)</li>
<li>We&#39;ll loop over the set of odd columns (<code>for (i in set)</code>)</li>
</ul>
