\bb{XPath in \code{"xml2"}}
To work with XPath expressions using the \code{"xml2"} package, we have the auxiliary function {\hilit \code{xml\char`_find\char`_all()}} that accepts XPath expressions in order to
select node-sets. Its main usage is:
\begin{verbatim}
    xml_find_all(xml_doc, xpath)
\end{verbatim}
\eb

where {\hilit \code{doc}} is an object of class \code{"xml\char`_document"} and {\hilit \code{xpath}} is a string giving the XPath expression to be evaluated
